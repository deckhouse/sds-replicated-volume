        summary: Replicated pool is not managed through ReplicatedStorageClass
        description: |
          There are storage classes in the cluster that are not managed through ReplicatedStorageClass objects, but manually. 
          It is necessary to migrate from them to storage classes that are managed through ReplicatedStorageClass. 
          The list of outdated storage classes can be obtained through
          
          `kubectl get sc -l storage.deckhouse.io/managed-by!=sds-replicated-volume`
