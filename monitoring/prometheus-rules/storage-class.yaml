        summary: DRBD pool is not managed through DRBDStorageClass
        description: |
          There are storage classes in the cluster that are not managed through DRBDStorageClass objects, but manually. 
          It is necessary to migrate from them to storage classes that are managed through DRBDStorageClass. 
          The list of outdated storage classes can be obtained through
          
          `kubectl get sc -l storage.deckhouse.io/managed-by!=sds-drbd`
