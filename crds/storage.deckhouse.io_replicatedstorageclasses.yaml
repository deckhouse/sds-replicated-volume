This corresponds to `placementCount = 2` and `AutoEvictMinReplicaCount = 2`. **Important:** this mode does not guarantee data consistency and may lead to split brain and data loss in case of network connectivity issues between nodes. Recommended only for non-critical data and applications that do not require high reliability and data integrity.
                  - ConsistencyAndAvailability — In this mode the volume remains readable and writable when one replica node fails. Data is stored in three copies on different nodes (`placementCount = 3`, `AutoEvictMinReplicaCount = 3`). This mode provides protection against data loss when two nodes containing volume replicas fail and guarantees data consistency. However, if two replicas are lost, the volume switches to suspend-io mode.
