# FIRD-CORE-7: The LOCAL series

This document registers the `LOCAL` series, as required by [FIRD-CORE-5]. It defines what kinds of FIRDs belong in `LOCAL` and establishes the portability boundary between `LOCAL` and non-`LOCAL` series.

Normative key words are defined in [FIRD-CORE-1#normative-words].

## Scope

This FIRD applies when creating, editing, or reviewing FIRDs, and when deciding whether a FIRD belongs to the `LOCAL` series.

This FIRD defines:
- the purpose of the `LOCAL` series; and
- the series-level portability boundary between `LOCAL` and all non-`LOCAL` series.

## Status of this FIRD

Status: Draft.

## 1. Terminology

- **Local FIRD** — a FIRD in the `LOCAL` series whose rules are environment-specific and not intended to be portable across environments.
- **Portable FIRD** — a FIRD that does not depend on environment-specific rules; in particular, a Portable FIRD MUST NOT reference the `LOCAL` series (per Section 3).
- **Portability boundary** — a series-level restriction on cross-series references, intended to prevent non-portable dependencies from leaking into portable FIRDs.

## 2. What the `LOCAL` series is for

- A FIRD contributor MUST place a FIRD in the `LOCAL` series if the FIRD’s rules are environment-specific and not intended to be portable.
- A FIRD contributor MUST NOT place such environment-specific rules in a non-`LOCAL` series.

> [!INFORMATIVE]
> A practical test: if a rule only makes sense in a particular environment (repository layout, tooling integration, installation-specific process), it belongs in `LOCAL`.

## 3. Reference boundary: non-`LOCAL` must not reference `LOCAL`

### 3.1 Allowed referenced series for `LOCAL`

The `LOCAL` series is registered with the following series-level allowlist:

- **Allowed referenced series** (in the sense of [FIRD-CORE-5]): `*` (any registered non-`LOCAL` series)

> [!INFORMATIVE]
> References to the `CORE` series are always permitted by the series registration rules in [FIRD-CORE-5]. The allowlist above controls cross-series references beyond `CORE`.

### 3.2 Prohibited `LOCAL` references from non-`LOCAL` FIRDs

- A FIRD contributor MUST ensure that any FIRD whose series is not `LOCAL` contains no references to any FIRD whose series is `LOCAL`.

For the purposes of this section, a “reference” includes:

- any rule reference or term reference to a `LOCAL` FIRD token (as defined in [FIRD-CORE-1#fird-references]); and
- any such reference even if marked Informative (for example, via `INFORMATIVE:`), or even if it appears inside Informative content.

> [!INFORMATIVE]
> This rule intentionally prohibits “for reference” pointers from portable FIRDs to local FIRDs. The goal is to prevent local dependencies from leaking into portable documents and ecosystems.

## 4. How to handle local details without breaking portability

- When a rule has both a portable core and environment-specific details, a FIRD contributor SHOULD split it into:
  - a Portable FIRD (non-`LOCAL`) that defines the portable core; and
  - a `LOCAL` FIRD that defines the environment-specific implementation details.

- A FIRD contributor SHOULD avoid duplicating portable rules into `LOCAL` FIRDs unless duplication is necessary for local clarity.
