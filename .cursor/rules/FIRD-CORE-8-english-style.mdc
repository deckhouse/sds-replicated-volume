# FIRD-CORE-8: English usage and style for FIRDs

This FIRD defines conventions for English usage and editorial style in FIRDs.

Normative key words are defined in [FIRD-CORE-1#normative-words].

## Scope

This FIRD applies to English prose written in FIRDs, including:

- normative statements written in English; and
- Informative explanations written in English.

This FIRD defines:

- baseline editorial authority for English prose in FIRDs; and
- additional standards-style technical prose conventions adapted for FIRDs.

This FIRD does not define:

- document structure rules, markup conventions, or formatting rules for FIRDs; or
- the meaning of normative key words (defined in [FIRD-CORE-1#normative-words]).

## Status of this FIRD

Status: Draft.

## 1. Style authority and precedence

### 1.1 Baseline editorial authority

A FIRD contributor MUST follow **The Chicago Manual of Style (CMOS)** for English grammar, punctuation, capitalization, and general editorial decisions, except where overridden by:

- this FIRD; or
- any other applicable FIRD requirement.

> [!INFORMATIVE]
> This FIRD deliberately includes a small number of technical-writing exceptions where strict CMOS typography can create ambiguity (for example, punctuation placement around literal tokens).

### 1.2 Precedence of requirements over style

If a stylistic convention conflicts with an applicable FIRD requirement, the FIRD requirement takes precedence.

A FIRD contributor MUST NOT make a stylistic edit that changes the technical meaning of a requirement or its applicability.

### 1.3 Literals, identifiers, and exact strings

A FIRD contributor MUST preserve the spelling and casing of:

- identifiers (function names, types, variables, protocol elements);
- commands and flags;
- file and package names;
- stable string values and constants; and
- any other literal tokens where a spelling change would alter meaning.

A FIRD contributor MUST place surrounding punctuation so that it does not alter the literal.

> [!INFORMATIVE]
> This rule often matters more than typographic preference.

### 1.4 FIRD agent behavior for stylistic uncertainty

A FIRD agent acting as a FIRD contributor MUST follow all explicit rules in applicable FIRDs.

If a FIRD agent cannot confidently determine the CMOS-preferred choice for a purely stylistic edit, and the edit is not required for correctness or clarity, the FIRD agent SHOULD avoid making the change.

## 2. Editorial philosophy for FIRDs

This section adapts the intent of RFC 7322 Section 2 (“RFC Editor’s Philosophy”) to the FIRD authoring context.

### 2.1 Editorial goals

A FIRD contributor SHOULD aim to:

- make the document as clear, consistent, and readable as possible;
- correct larger clarity issues; and
- fix internal inconsistencies (for example, terms that appear in multiple forms, duplicated text, or inconsistent capitalization).

If a passage is unclear in a way that could affect interpretation, a FIRD contributor SHOULD flag it explicitly rather than guessing.

### 2.2 Consistency targets

A FIRD contributor SHOULD strive for consistency within:

- the document itself; and
- a coherent set of related FIRDs (for example, FIRDs that are commonly used together or define adjacent concepts).

### 2.3 Editorial balance and meaning preservation

A FIRD contributor MUST treat editing as distinct from technical review.

A FIRD contributor MAY suggest wording changes for clarity, but a FIRD contributor MUST NOT prefer an editorial convention over wording that is a more accurate representation of the intended technical meaning.

A FIRD contributor MUST follow this prime directive over grammatical conventions:

- do not change the intended meaning of the text.

If a proposed edit has a serious risk of altering meaning, a FIRD contributor MUST NOT apply it and SHOULD instead request clarification or review.

## 3. Style conventions

This section adapts RFC 7322 Section 3 (“RFC Style Conventions”) subsections 3.1–3.6 for FIRDs, excluding RFC-specific publication-process rules.

### 3.1 Language and spelling

A FIRD contributor MUST use American English spelling as the default for English prose in FIRDs.

A FIRD contributor MUST keep spelling internally consistent within a document.

A FIRD contributor MUST preserve the original spelling of proper names and quoted material.

### 3.2 Punctuation and quotation handling

A FIRD contributor MUST use the serial comma (Oxford comma) in English lists where doing so improves clarity.

When quoting **literal text** (for example, a literal string to search for, an exact token, or an identifier), a FIRD contributor MUST place surrounding punctuation **outside** quotation marks so the quoted literal remains exact.

When quoting **general prose** (for example, a sentence from another document), punctuation SHOULD follow normal CMOS conventions.

A FIRD contributor SHOULD omit quotation marks when a quotation is presented as a block quotation.

### 3.3 DNS names and URIs in examples

DNS names used as generic examples (including those embedded in URIs) SHOULD use the reserved example names defined in “Reserved Top Level DNS Names” (BCP 32) to avoid accidental conflicts.

A FIRD contributor SHOULD avoid using real production domains as “generic examples”.

> [!INFORMATIVE]
> Common example domains include `example.com`, `example.net`, and `example.org`.

### 3.4 Capitalization

A FIRD contributor MUST keep capitalization consistent within a document.

A FIRD contributor SHOULD keep capitalization consistent with closely related FIRDs when the terms refer to the same concept.

For titles and section titles, a FIRD contributor SHOULD follow CMOS title-capitalization conventions (title case) unless the title is written as a full sentence, in which case sentence capitalization SHOULD be used.

Figure titles MAY use either sentence form or title case, but a document SHOULD be consistent.

### 3.5 Citations and cross-references

A FIRD contributor MUST ensure that references and citations match:

- every citation has a corresponding reference entry; and
- every reference entry is cited.

When referring to locations within a document or another document, a FIRD contributor MUST NOT rely on page numbers.

A FIRD contributor SHOULD prefer stable section references (for example, section titles, section numbers when present, or stable anchors where applicable).

> [!INFORMATIVE]
> Pagination can change across renderers and devices; stable section references do not.

### 3.6 Abbreviation rules

A FIRD contributor SHOULD expand abbreviations in FIRD titles and upon first use in running prose.

When expanding an abbreviation, a FIRD contributor SHOULD follow this pattern:

- `<full expansion> (<abbreviation>)`

A FIRD contributor MAY omit expanding an abbreviation if it appears in the online **RFC Production Center Abbreviations List**.

A FIRD contributor SHOULD expand an abbreviation even if it appears in that list when, in the author’s judgment, the abbreviation is likely to be unclear in the specific context.

A FIRD contributor MUST use a single expansion consistently within a document when an abbreviation has multiple plausible expansions.

## 4. Additional technical prose guidance

A FIRD contributor MUST write requirements so that they are unambiguous and reviewable.

A FIRD contributor SHOULD apply the following standards-style technical prose practices:

- Prefer short, declarative sentences for requirements.
- Avoid ambiguous pronouns (“it”, “this”, “that”) when the referent could be unclear.
- Prefer explicit subjects (“A FIRD contributor …”, “A FIRD agent …”, “FIRD conformers …”) over implied subjects.
- Use parallel structure in lists and sublists.
- Avoid burying critical conditions in parenthetical asides.
- When a requirement has multiple conditions, structure the text so the logical relationships are explicit (for example, by splitting into separate sentences or clearly scoped clauses).

> [!INFORMATIVE]
> A useful review test: a reader should be able to answer “Who must do what, when, and under which conditions?” without inference.
