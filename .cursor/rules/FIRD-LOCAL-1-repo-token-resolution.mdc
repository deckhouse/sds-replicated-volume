# FIRD-LOCAL-1: Working with FIRDs in this repository

## 1. Resolving FIRD reference tokens in this repository

Within this repository, FIRDs are stored as `.mdc` files under `.cursor/rules/`.

Within this repository, a FIRD reference token `FIRD-<SERIES>-<N>` MUST resolve to exactly one `.mdc` file under `.cursor/rules/` whose basename begins with `FIRD-<SERIES>-<N>` and is followed by either:

- the end of the basename (for example, `FIRD-EXAMPLE-12.mdc`), or
- a non-digit character (for example, `FIRD-EXAMPLE-12-something.mdc`).

If there is no matching file, or if there is more than one matching file, the reference is unresolved or ambiguous.
