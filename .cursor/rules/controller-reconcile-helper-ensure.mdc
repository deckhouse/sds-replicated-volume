# EnsureReconcileHelper

This document defines naming and contracts for **EnsureReconcileHelper** functions/methods.

Common terminology and rules for any **ReconcileHelper** live in `controller-reconcile-helper.mdc`.

---

## TL;DR

Summary only; if anything differs, follow normative sections below.

- **EnsureReconcileHelpers** (`ensure*`) are **pure**, **deterministic**, strictly **non-I/O** in-place steps for **exactly one** **patch domain** (**main patch domain** or **status patch domain**) that compute/enforce the per-step **target** (and/or status **report**) and immediately bring `obj` to it.
- They mutate the caller-owned `obj` to the computed **target** / **report** and return **Outcome** (in code: `flow.Outcome`) that encodes:
  - whether `obj` was changed,
  - whether the subsequent save requires **Optimistic locking**,
  - and whether an error occurred.
- **EnsureReconcileHelpers** are the **single source of truth** for **Change reporting** and **optimistic lock requirement** for their **patch domain**.
- **Reconcile methods** MUST implement patch execution according to **Outcome** (in code: `flow.Outcome`) (`DidChange` / `OptimisticLockRequired`) and MUST NOT override these decisions with ad-hoc logic.
- They MUST NOT perform **Kubernetes API I/O**, call **DeepCopy**, or execute patches / make **patch ordering** decisions.
- If both **main patch domain** and **status patch domain** need changes, split into **two** **EnsureReconcileHelpers** (one per **patch domain**) and patch them separately in **Reconcile methods**.

---

## Definition

An **EnsureReconcileHelper** (“ensure helper”) is a **ReconcileHelper** that is:

- **strictly non-I/O**, and
- computes/enforces the per-step **target** (and/or status **report**) and immediately performs in-place mutations on the object to bring it to that state for **exactly one patch domain** (**main resource** or **status subresource**), and
- returns a `flow.Outcome` that reports whether it changed the object, whether optimistic locking is required for the save operation (if any), and whether an error occurred.

Typical ensure helpers implement step-by-step in-place reconciliation and return `flow.Outcome` (e.g., via `flow.Continue().ReportChanged()`, `flow.ContinueErr(...)`, `flow.Done()`, `flow.Fail(err)`, etc.) to drive patching decisions in **Reconcile methods**.

Notes on `.status` (role vs location):
- A status-domain ensure helper may write both:
  - **controller-owned state** (persisted decisions/memory derived from **target**), and/or
  - the published **report** (conditions/progress/selected observations).
- The published **report** MAY directly reuse selected **actual** observations (including being the same value/type as an **actual** snapshot). Persisting such observations into `.status` is OK and they remain **report/observations** (output-only).
- Status-domain ensure helpers MUST NOT treat existing **report/observations** as “intent/config inputs” for new **target** decisions.
  - However, they MAY use existing **report/observations** (including previously published report fields in `.status`) as observation/constraint inputs (i.e., as a cached/stale form of **actual**) when deriving a new **target**.
  - If prior decisions must be stable across reconciles, that input MUST come from explicit **controller-owned state** fields (by design), not from arbitrary report fields.

---

## Naming

- An **EnsureReconcileHelper** name MUST start with `ensure` / `Ensure`.
- **EnsureReconcileHelpers** MUST be domain-explicit in the name when ambiguity is possible (ambiguity is possible when the ensured invariant/property name refers to a field/group that exists in both `.spec` (**main patch domain**) and `.status` (**status patch domain**) of the same **object**):
  - `ensureMain*` / `EnsureMain*` (**main patch domain**)
  - `ensureStatus*` / `EnsureStatus*` (**status patch domain**)
- **EnsureReconcileHelpers** SHOULD NOT include `Main` / `Status` in the name when there is no such ambiguity.
- **EnsureReconcileHelpers** names SHOULD name the invariant or property being ensured:
  - `ensureFinalizer(...)`
  - `ensureOwnerRefs(...)`
  - `ensureLabels(...)`
  - `ensureStatusConditions(...)` (conditions are typically part of the published **report**)
- **EnsureReconcileHelpers** names MUST NOT include `Desired` / `Actual` / `Intended` / `Target` / `Report` unless the applied “thing” name in the **object** API includes those words.
  - Exception: helpers that explicitly build/publish a status **report** artifact MAY end with `Report` when it improves clarity (e.g., `ensureStatusReport`, `ensureConditionsReport`).
- **EnsureReconcileHelpers** names MUST NOT sound like orchestration (`ensureAll`, `ensureEverything`, `ensureAndPatch`) — ensure helpers do not execute **I/O**; they only mutate and return **Outcome** (in code, the type is `flow.Outcome`).

---

## Preferred signatures

- For **EnsureReconcileHelpers** (`ensure*`), the simplest signature from the variants below that preserves explicit dependencies and flow semantics SHOULD be chosen.
- If additional signature variants are explicitly permitted elsewhere in this document, they MAY also be used.

### Simple ensure
```go
func ensureFoo(obj *v1alpha1.Foo) flow.Outcome
```

Or, if an ensure helper needs data from `Reconciler`:
```go
func (r *Reconciler) ensureFoo(obj *v1alpha1.Foo) flow.Outcome
```

### Ensure with logging / phases
```go
func ensureFoo(
    ctx context.Context,
    obj *v1alpha1.Foo,
) flow.Outcome
```

Or, if an ensure helper needs data from `Reconciler`:
```go
func (r *Reconciler) ensureFoo(
    ctx context.Context,
    obj *v1alpha1.Foo,
) flow.Outcome
```

### Dependent ensure
Dependencies MUST be explicit and come **after `obj`**:
```go
func ensureBar(
    ctx context.Context,
    obj *v1alpha1.Foo,
    targetFoo TargetFoo,
) flow.Outcome
```

Or, if an ensure helper needs data from `Reconciler`:
```go
func (r *Reconciler) ensureBar(
    ctx context.Context,
    obj *v1alpha1.Foo,
    targetFoo TargetFoo,
) flow.Outcome
```

---

## Receivers

- **EnsureReconcileHelpers** SHOULD be plain functions when they do not need any data from `Reconciler`.
- If an **EnsureReconcileHelper** needs data from `Reconciler`, it MUST be a method on `Reconciler`.

---

## I/O boundaries

**EnsureReconcileHelpers** MUST NOT do any of the following:

- controller-runtime client usage (`client.Client`, `r.client`, etc.);
- Kubernetes API calls (`Get/List/Create/Update/Patch/Delete`);
- `DeepCopy` (including `obj.DeepCopy()`, `runtime.Object.DeepCopyObject()`, etc.);
- executing patches (`Patch` / `Status().Patch`) or making any patch ordering decisions;
- creating/updating/deleting Kubernetes objects in the API server in any form.

**EnsureReconcileHelpers** MUST NOT do “hidden I/O” either:

- `time.Now()` / `time.Since(...)` (nondeterministic wall-clock reads) (except setting `metav1.Condition.LastTransitionTime`, typically indirectly via `obju.SetStatusCondition`);
- random number generation (`rand.*`);
- environment reads (`os.Getenv`, reading files);
- network calls of any kind.

**EnsureReconcileHelpers** MAY request **Optimistic locking** by encoding it in the returned `flow.Outcome`, but they MUST NOT perform the save operation themselves.

> Rationale: ensure helpers should be **deterministic** and unit-testable; they describe the in-memory mutations required to reach the chosen **target** and/or publish the status **report** (and any save-mode requirements), while the actual persistence belongs to **Reconcile methods**.

---

## Determinism contract

An **EnsureReconcileHelper** MUST be **deterministic** given its explicit inputs and allowed in-place mutations.

See the common determinism contract in `controller-reconcile-helper.mdc`.

In particular:
- **EnsureReconcileHelpers** MAY use extracted computation/caching components owned by the reconciler (e.g. “world view” / “planner” / “topology scorer”, caches), as described in `controller-file-structure.mdc` (“Additional components”), as long as they do not violate the I/O boundaries above.
  - Note: cache population is a side effect and an additional source of state; therefore, the helper is deterministic only relative to that state. For the same explicit inputs and the same state of these components, the result MUST be the same.
- Returned `flow.Outcome` flags (changed / optimisticLock / error) MUST be stable for the same inputs and object state.

> Practical reason: nondeterminism creates patch churn and flaky tests.

---

## Read-only contract

`ensure*` / `Ensure*` MUST treat all inputs except the intended in-place mutation on `obj` as read-only:

- it MUST NOT mutate any input other than `obj` (including computed dependencies passed after `obj`, templates, shared defaults, global variables);
- it MUST mutate only the intended patch domain on `obj` (main resource **or** status subresource), treating the other domain as read-only;
- it MUST NOT perform in-place modifications through aliases to non-`obj` data.

Note: reconciler-owned deterministic components (e.g. caches) are allowed mutation targets in `ensure*` helpers **only** under the constraints defined above (non-I/O, explicit dependency, deterministic relative to the component state).
If an `ensure*` helper mutates such a component, its GoDoc comment MUST explicitly state that this helper mutates reconciler-owned deterministic state and why this is acceptable (rare-case exception).

See the common read-only contract in `controller-reconcile-helper.mdc` (especially the Go aliasing rule for `map` / `[]T`).

---

## Patch-domain separation

- `ensure*` / `Ensure*` MUST mutate `obj` in-place for **exactly one** patch domain:
  - main resource (**metadata + spec + non-status fields**), **or**
  - status subresource (`.status`).
- An **EnsureReconcileHelper** MUST NOT mutate both domains in the same function.
- If you need “ensure” logic for both domains, you MUST split it into **two** ensure helpers and call them separately from **Reconcile methods** (with separate patch requests).

✅ Separate ensure helpers (GOOD)
```go
func ensureMainFoo(obj *v1alpha1.Foo) flow.Outcome
func ensureStatusFoo(obj *v1alpha1.Foo) flow.Outcome
```

❌ Mixed ensure (BAD)
```go
func ensureFoo(obj *v1alpha1.Foo) flow.Outcome {
    // mutates spec/metadata AND status in one helper
    return flow.Continue()
}
```

---

## Composition

- An **EnsureReconcileHelper** MAY implement multiple related “ensure” steps in one pass **within a single** **patch domain**.
  - If these steps represent one conceptual invariant set, they SHOULD remain in one ensure helper.
  - If steps are distinguishable and reused independently, they SHOULD be extracted into smaller ensure helpers.
- An **EnsureReconcileHelper** MAY call other ensure helpers (compose “sub-ensures”).
- An **EnsureReconcileHelper** MAY call **ConstructionReconcileHelpers** (`new*`, `build*`, `make*`, `compose*`) as pure building blocks, as long as it stays strictly **non-I/O** and **deterministic**.
- An **EnsureReconcileHelper** MAY depend on outputs of previous compute helpers:
  - the dependency MUST be explicit in the signature as additional args **after `obj`**.
- If an **EnsureReconcileHelper** composes multiple sub-ensures, it MUST combine their results deterministically:
  - “changed” information MUST be preserved (no dropping);
  - optimistic-locking requirement MUST be preserved;
  - errors MUST be preserved (no dropping), using a deterministic aggregation strategy (e.g., `flow.Merge(...)`).

---

## Flow phases and **Outcome**

- A **large** **EnsureReconcileHelper** MUST create a `reconcile/flow` **phase** (`flow.BeginPhase` / `flow.EndPhase`).
  - “Large” includes any **EnsureReconcileHelper** that:
    - has many sub-steps, or
    - **loops over items**, or
    - handles errors (non-trivial error handling / many failure branches).
  - The **phase** MUST cover the whole function (one **phase** per function); **phases** MUST NOT be started inside loops. Follow `internal/reconciliation/flow` phase placement rules.
- A **small** **EnsureReconcileHelper** MUST NOT create a `reconcile/flow` **phase** (keep it small and mechanical; let the caller add error boundaries via `Enrichf`).
- If it creates a **phase** (or writes logs), it MUST accept `ctx context.Context` (see `controller-reconcile-helper.mdc`).
- **EnsureReconcileHelpers** MUST return **Outcome** (in code: `flow.Outcome`) using helpers from `internal/reconciliation/flow`:
  - `flow.Continue()`, `flow.Done()`, `flow.Fail(err)`, `flow.RequeueAfter(dur)`.
  - Use **Outcome** reporting (e.g., “changed” / **Optimistic locking** intent) via the `flow.Outcome` API.

### Recommended pattern: change + optimistic-lock reporting (SHOULD)

```go
func ensureFoo(obj *v1alpha1.Foo) flow.Outcome {
    changed := false
    needLock := false

    // ... deterministically mutate obj ...

    outcome := flow.Continue().ReportChangedIf(changed)
    if needLock {
        outcome = outcome.RequireOptimisticLock()
    }
    return outcome
}
```

```go
func ensureFoo(obj *v1alpha1.Foo) flow.Outcome {
    changed := false

    // ... deterministically mutate obj ...

    return flow.Continue().
        ReportChangedIf(changed).
        RequireOptimisticLock()
}
```

---

## Error handling

- See the common error handling rules in `controller-reconcile-helper.mdc`.
- **EnsureReconcileHelpers** SHOULD generally return errors as-is (e.g., via `flow.Fail(err)`).

  **Allowed (rare)**: when propagating a **non-local** error (e.g., from validation utilities or injected pure components) and additional context is necessary to **disambiguate multiple different error sources** within the same calling **Reconcile method**, an **EnsureReconcileHelper** MAY wrap with small, local context:
  - prefer `flow.Failf(err, "<local-action>")`
  - keep `<local-action>` specific to the helper responsibility (e.g., `ensureOwnerRefs`, `ensureStatusConditions`, `normalizeSpec`)

  **Forbidden (MUST NOT)**:
  - do not add **object identity** (e.g. `namespace/name`, UID, object key)
  - do not add generic “outside world” context (that belongs to the **Reconcile method**)

---

## Common anti-patterns (MUST NOT)

❌ Doing any Kubernetes API I/O (directly or indirectly):
```go
func ensureFoo(ctx context.Context, obj *v1alpha1.Foo) flow.Outcome {
    // forbidden: I/O in ensure
    var cm corev1.ConfigMap
    if err := r.client.Get(ctx, nn, &cm); err != nil {
        return flow.Fail(err)
    }
    return flow.Continue()
}
```

❌ Executing patches / updates / deletes (or hiding them behind helpers):
```go
func ensureFoo(ctx context.Context, obj *v1alpha1.Foo) flow.Outcome {
    // forbidden: patch execution belongs to Reconcile methods / PatchReconcileHelpers
    base := obj.DeepCopy() // also forbidden: DeepCopy in ensure
    obj.Spec.Replicas = 3
    _ = r.client.Patch(ctx, obj, client.MergeFrom(base))
    return flow.Continue().ReportChanged()
}
```

❌ Calling `DeepCopy` inside ensure helpers:
```go
func ensureFoo(obj *v1alpha1.Foo) flow.Outcome {
    _ = obj.DeepCopy() // forbidden: DeepCopy belongs to Reconcile methods
    return flow.Continue()
}
```

❌ Mutating both patch domains (main + status) in one ensure helper:
```go
func ensureFoo(obj *v1alpha1.Foo) flow.Outcome {
    obj.Spec.Replicas = 3            // main domain
    obj.Status.Phase = "Reconciling" // status domain (typically published **report**)
    // forbidden: ensure must touch exactly one patch domain
    return flow.Continue().ReportChanged()
}
```

❌ Returning “changed” inconsistently (mutated object but outcome does not report it):
```go
func ensureFoo(obj *v1alpha1.Foo) flow.Outcome {
    obj.Spec.Replicas = 3
    // forbidden: mutation happened, but outcome does not report change
    return flow.Continue()
}
```

❌ Reporting “changed” without actually changing the object:
```go
func ensureFoo(obj *v1alpha1.Foo) flow.Outcome {
    // forbidden: reports change but did not mutate anything
    return flow.Continue().ReportChanged()
}
```

❌ Requesting optimistic locking “sometimes” without determinism (same inputs -> different outcome):
```go
func ensureFoo(obj *v1alpha1.Foo) flow.Outcome {
    if rand.Int()%2 == 0 { // forbidden: nondeterministic
        obj.Spec.Replicas = 3
        return flow.Continue().ReportChanged().RequireOptimisticLock()
    }
    obj.Spec.Replicas = 3
    return flow.Continue().ReportChanged()
}
```

❌ Hidden I/O / nondeterminism (time/random/env/network):
```go
func ensureFoo(obj *v1alpha1.Foo) flow.Outcome {
    _ = time.Now()        // forbidden (except condition timestamps via obju)
    _ = rand.Int()        // forbidden
    _ = os.Getenv("FLAG") // forbidden
    return flow.Continue()
}
```

❌ Depending on map iteration order when building ordered slices (patch churn):
```go
func ensureFoo(obj *v1alpha1.Foo) flow.Outcome {
    out := make([]string, 0, len(obj.Spec.Flags))
    for k := range obj.Spec.Flags { // map iteration order is random
        out = append(out, k)
    }
    // missing sort => nondeterministic object state
    obj.Spec.FlagKeys = out
    return flow.Continue().ReportChanged()
}
```

❌ Mutating shared templates/defaults through aliasing:
```go
func ensureFoo(obj *v1alpha1.Foo, template *v1alpha1.Foo) flow.Outcome {
    // forbidden: template labels map is shared; mutating it mutates the template
    labels := template.GetLabels()
    labels["owned"] = "true"
    obj.SetLabels(labels)
    return flow.Continue().ReportChanged()
}
```

❌ Manual metadata/conditions manipulation when `objutilv1` (`obju`) must be used:
```go
func ensureFoo(obj *v1alpha1.Foo) flow.Outcome {
    // forbidden in this codebase: do not open-code label/finalizer/condition edits
    if obj.Labels == nil {
        obj.Labels = map[string]string{}
    }
    obj.Labels["a"] = "b"
    return flow.Continue().ReportChanged()
}
```
