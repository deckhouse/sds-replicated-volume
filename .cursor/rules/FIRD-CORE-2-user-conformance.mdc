# FIRD-CORE-2: FIRD user conformance (how FIRD users must follow FIRDs)

<a id="user-conformance"></a>
## 1. FIRD user conformance requirements

- A FIRD user MUST comply with all requirements addressed to the FIRD user in all Applicable FIRDs [FIRD-CORE-1#terms].
- If a FIRD agent reports a FIRD requirement conflict [FIRD-CORE-1#terms], a FIRD user MUST provide a resolution before the FIRD agent can proceed.
- When resolving a FIRD requirement conflict, a FIRD user SHOULD prefer resolving it via:
  - clarifying intent and constraints (and updating the request accordingly); and/or
  - changing the Applicable FIRDs (for example, by updating FIRDs).
- A FIRD user MAY authorize a FIRD requirement override [FIRD-CORE-1#terms] for a specific requirement.
- A FIRD user MUST NOT request or instruct a FIRD agent to ignore or violate applicable requirements except through an explicit FIRD requirement override that is recorded in the Work product [FIRD-CORE-1#terms] according to applicable override recording rules.
- If a FIRD user authorizes a FIRD requirement override, a FIRD user MUST ensure the override is recorded in the Work product.
- If a FIRD agent indicates that it cannot record a FIRD requirement override because no applicable override recording rules are available (or the rules are ambiguous), a FIRD user MUST provide a FIRD that defines how FIRD requirement overrides are recorded for the current Work product type.
- If a FIRD agent reports ambiguity or missing context required for compliance, a FIRD user SHOULD resolve it by clarifying intent and constraints (and, if necessary, by changing which FIRDs are in effect in the environment they are using).

## 2. YAML frontmatter

YAML frontmatter fields [FIRD-CORE-1#frontmatter]. How a FIRD agent determines Applicable FIRDs [FIRD-CORE-3#applicability].

- For the purposes of FIRD user conformance, a FIRD user MUST ignore the values of `description` and `alwaysApply`.
- The `globs` field is informative to the FIRD user:
  - A FIRD user MAY read `globs` as a hint about intended applicability.
  - A FIRD user MUST NOT treat `globs` as defining which FIRDs are in effect for the task.

## 3. Referencing FIRDs

- A FIRD user SHOULD reference FIRDs using a FIRD reference token (for example, `FIRD-EXAMPLE-12`) to avoid ambiguity [FIRD-CORE-1#fird-references].
- When referencing a specific section, a FIRD user SHOULD prefer a FIRD section reference token (for example, `FIRD-EXAMPLE-12#some-anchor`).
