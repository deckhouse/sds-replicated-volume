# FIRD-CORE-6: The CORE series

This document registers the `CORE` series, as required by [FIRD-CORE-5]. It defines what kinds of FIRDs belong in `CORE`, and the series-level dependency expectations for `CORE`.

Normative key words are defined in [FIRD-CORE-1#normative-words].

## Scope

This FIRD applies when creating, editing, or reviewing FIRDs, and when deciding whether a FIRD belongs to the `CORE` series.

This FIRD defines:
- the purpose of the `CORE` series;
- what kinds of FIRDs belong in the `CORE` series; and
- series-level dependency expectations for `CORE`.

## Status of this FIRD

Status: Draft.

## 1. Terminology

- **CORE series** — the series identifier `CORE`, reserved for FIRDs that define the system-wide interpretation, conformance, and other foundational mechanics of FIRDs.
- **Core rule** — a rule that defines FIRD interpretation, FIRD conformance expectations, or other system-level mechanics intended to apply broadly across the FIRD system (as opposed to environment-specific or project-specific rules).

## 2. What belongs in CORE

- A FIRD contributor MUST place a FIRD in the `CORE` series only if the FIRD defines one or more Core rules.
- A FIRD contributor MUST NOT place environment-specific, repository-specific, or tooling-specific rules in the `CORE` series.

> [!INFORMATIVE]
> A practical test: if a rule would not make sense outside a specific environment, repository, or tooling context, it is not a Core rule and does not belong in `CORE`.

## 3. Dependency expectations

### 3.1 Allowed referenced series

The `CORE` series is registered with the following series-level allowlist:

- **Allowed referenced series** (in the sense of [FIRD-CORE-5]): *(none)*

As a consequence:

- FIRDs in the `CORE` series MUST NOT make cross-series references to any non-`CORE` series.

> [!INFORMATIVE]
> This keeps `CORE` self-contained and portable. It also prevents `CORE` rules from accidentally depending on non-core policies that may evolve independently.

### 3.2 Compatibility and evolution expectations

- A FIRD contributor SHOULD treat changes to `CORE` FIRDs as high-impact and SHOULD avoid silent semantic changes to existing requirements.
- If a Core rule needs a breaking change, a FIRD contributor SHOULD prefer introducing a new Core FIRD (new reference token) and using document Status to mark the old document as Deprecated or Replaced, rather than rewriting the old rule in-place.
